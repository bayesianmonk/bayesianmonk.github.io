## Overview

Developed a comprehensive predictive maintenance system that analyzes sensor data from industrial equipment to forecast potential failures before they occur.

## Key Features

- **Time Series Analysis**: Implemented LSTM networks to capture temporal patterns in sensor readings
- **Real-time Processing**: Built streaming pipeline to process 10,000+ data points per second
- **Anomaly Detection**: Combined statistical methods with deep learning for early failure detection
- **Dashboard Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards using Plotly.js for operations teams

## Technical Stack

- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Apache Kafka for data streaming
- PostgreSQL for time-series data storage
- React + Plotly.js for visualization

## Results

- 40% reduction in unplanned downtime
- 25% decrease in maintenance costs
- 95% accuracy in failure prediction (7-day window)
