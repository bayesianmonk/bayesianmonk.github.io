## Introduction

Bayesian inference offers a powerful framework for reasoning under uncertainty. Unlike frequentist statistics, Bayesian methods allow us to incorporate prior knowledge and update our beliefs as new data arrives.

## Why Bayesian?

1. **Intuitive**: Results are expressed as probabilities, which are easier to interpret
2. **Flexible**: Can incorporate domain knowledge through priors
3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides full probability distributions, not just point estimates

## Basic Concepts

### Prior, Likelihood, and Posterior

The fundamental equation of Bayesian inference:

```
Posterior ∝ Likelihood × Prior
```

This simple relationship allows us to update our beliefs systematically.

## Practical Example

Let's walk through a real-world example of Bayesian A/B testing...
